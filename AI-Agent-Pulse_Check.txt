Eva AI Agent: PulseCheck Ai “Know how your guest feels before they say it.”
1. Background & Purpose
Purpose: Predict potential bad reviews before check-out based on guest communication patterns and dynamically launch agentic workflows to mitigate guest dissatisfaction—ensuring higher review scores and fewer complaints.
As the volume of short-term rental bookings continues to rise, so does the risk of guest dissatisfaction turning into public negative reviews. Reviews directly impact a property's visibility and profitability across platforms like Airbnb, VRBO, and Booking.com. Eva’s PulseCheck is an intelligent AI agent designed to preemptively identify and respond to dissatisfied guests before they check out—when there's still time to recover the experience and avoid reputational damage.
This agent actively monitors communication from the moment a reservation is made until the check-out date, leveraging advanced sentiment analysis and contextual pattern recognition to evaluate the likelihood of a negative review and overall predict the guest sentiment before the guest says it or leaves a review... If it detects that a guest may be unhappy, it triggers personalized recovery workflows. If it predicts guest is happy, it triggers a personalized review  leaving encouragement workflow These interventions are meant to reassure guests, resolve issues, and either restore guest satisfaction or escalate to a human agent when AI resolution is no longer effective.
Originally developed to integrate seamlessly with hosteeva, the agent is designed with a modular, API-driven architecture, making it suitable for external deployment with other PMS, CRM, or communication systems. Its core logic, scoring engine, and workflow system can operate independently by connecting to any data stream containing guest interactions—enabling white-label use by third-party customers.

2. Core Functionality
Feature
	Description
	Guest Sentiment Monitoring
	Continuously analyze guest messages, calls, inquiries, and requests pre-stay and mid-stay using sentiment analysis + behavior classification.
	Dynamic Happiness Score
	Score guest satisfaction on a 0–10 scale. Trigger workflows can be divided to 4 stages: 0-2, 3-6, 7-8, 9-10
	Real-Time Alerts
	Notify appropriate agents and leadership? (Customer Experience Agent, Housekeeping, Revenue, etc.) when dissatisfaction trends are detected.
	Remediation Workflow Engine
	Launch appropriate workflows based on frustration severity—e.g., offer refund, escalate to a human agent, schedule extra cleaning, provide discount, or send apology messages.
	Profile Updating Engine
	Continuously update guest sentiment profile in real time with every new interaction (message, call, support case, etc.). ( can we include a rule that black lists a guest if they have had 2 or 3 (or more) stays with us and have complained on each and every stay. ( when to fire our guests ) 
	Outcome Tracker
	Evaluate if happiness score improves after a remediation effort. Track whether guest ended up leaving a review—and its rating.
	Escalation Trigger
	When the AI detects that a situation is beyond automated resolution (e.g., emotional escalation, unresolved issues despite action), it flags the case for Human Reputation Agent escalation.
	Task Generation Engine
	Every guest-facing interaction from an AI agent is logged as a task, tracked, and visible in task dashboards for audit and performance metrics.

3. How It Works
Monitoring Layer
* Ingests all guest communication channels: SMS, WhatsApp, email, chat, voice call transcript (via Eva Voice AI), Zendesk tickets.
* Uses Hosteeva's Unified Messaging System and Eva AI Voice logs.
* Sentiment & intent detection powered by custom-trained NLP models on hospitality communication.
Happiness Scoring Logic
* Guest starts with a score of 10.
* Negative phrases, tone, repeated complaints, lack of engagement, or escalating requests reduce the score.
* Positive feedback or accepted upsell offers increase the score.
Trigger Thresholds
Score
	Risk Level
	Workflow Triggered
	9–10
	Low
	Continue normal service
	7–8
	Medium
	Monitor closely; suggest light-touch engagement (e.g. check-in message)
	5–6
	High
	Send “apology + offer to improve stay” message; escalate to human if unresolved
	<5
	Critical
	Trigger strong retention tactic (refund, discount, escalation, etc.)
	N/A
	Escalation
	If AI determines it's unable to resolve the issue (low confidence, unrecognized patterns, aggressive language), auto-escalate to Human Reputation Agent

4. Sample Remediation Workflows(but configurable)
Risk Level
	Sample Agentic Actions
	Medium
	Friendly check-in: “We hope you’re loving your stay—if there’s anything we can improve, just let us know!”
	High
	“We noticed something may not be perfect—let’s fix it today. Would an extra cleaning or late check-out help?”
	Critical
	“We truly apologize for the experience. We’ve issued a $X refund and added a 15% credit for your next stay.”
	Escalation
	Notify Human Agent: “This guest may require human intervention due to unresolved concerns or emotional tone escalation. Please review and take control.”
	All workflows:
* Log to Hosteeva system.
* Create a Work Item (type: ReputationRisk) and assign to Hosteeva Reputation Agent.
* Include link to transcript and summary of detected issues.

5. Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: Quick Resolution with Refund
* Guest complains on Airbnb: "The apartment wasn’t cleaned properly."
* AI assigns happiness score of 5.
* Agentic response: "We sincerely apologize—this is not our standard. Would a refund of $40 help make things right?"
* Guest accepts. Refund is issued automatically.
* Score increases to 8. No review left or a positive one.
Scenario 2: Negotiated Recovery with Discount and Refund
* Guest raises multiple issues over 48 hours (slow Wi-Fi, broken lamp, poor communication).
* Happiness score drops to 4.
* AI offers a 10% future stay discount → guest not satisfied.
* AI escalates offer to 20% refund + note of apology.
* Guest accepts. Issue flagged as resolved. Human intervention avoided.
Scenario 3: Polite Apology and Offer to Improve
* Guest comments mid-stay: "The place is okay but not what I expected."
* AI detects sentiment drop from 9 → 6.
* Response: "We appreciate the feedback and want to make it better. Could we offer a late check-out or send someone over for a quick refresh?"
* Guest replies positively, issue is logged, and final review score remains 9.
Scenario 4: Escalation to Human Reputation Agent
* Guest sends three aggressive messages expressing dissatisfaction with check-in, cleanliness, and support.
* Score drops to 3. AI attempts a compensation offer but guest refuses.
* System triggers escalation: Work Item created and assigned to human agent with transcript and timeline.

13. Task Tracking & Agent Accountability
Each agent action is converted into a distinct Task, which includes:
* Task type (e.g., Message, Offer Refund, Send KB Article, Escalation Notice)
* Associated guest + reservation
* Timestamp of execution
* Outcome status (Pending, Completed, Escalated)
* Agent (AI or Human) who performed the action
These tasks are:
* Logged into the central Task Registry
* Viewable on the Task Dashboard, with filtering by date, outcome, agent type, and frustration level
* Used to compute per-agent performance metrics and detect bottlenecks
* Synced to work items in Zendesk or Jira if applicable
A Task Lifecycle API is exposed for external system integration or manual override.
